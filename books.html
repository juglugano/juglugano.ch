					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">The book initially guides you step-by-step in the setup of the development environment on Linux/MacOS/Windows giving important tips about how to solve platform-specific issues to ensure a quick start also for less skilled users. <br />
I have greatly appreciated that in the first part of the book the basic concepts are explained in a meaningful order and without all the details, leaving the developer with the taste of the choices that have brought the Android platform to life. On the contrary, the official Android documentation, despite being well made, follows the natural way of its underlying support, the web: every topic is tackled separately but the cross-references could easily confuse the novice. <br />
After the initial overview, the essential components of an Android application are dissected using working code snippets and illustrations. It has been very useful for me that the authors have inserted on purpose some errors in the code to reproduce the most common and hard to spot mistakes every Android developer will encounter on his/her path.<br />
Speaking of weak points, there are two choices that left me slightly disappointed. Also if Java for Android is not directly related to the Sun implementation, from a practical point of view the language syntax perfectly matches and the APIs contain the same classes with the same methods, so I think that it's a nonsense to spend an entire chapter trying to teach the basics of Java: it is too short for somebody that has never used it and useless for everybody else.  I was also surprised that there is no mention of libraries that can simplify the development, e.g. AndroidAnnotations.<br />
All in all, this book covers in great detail and with simple examples every aspect an Android developer could be interested in, guiding him/her building a well-designed, modular, reusable and robust application.</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">This book is dedicated to advanced Javascript developers who wants to extend their knowledge. Author tries to explain in his best way how to implement most known design patterns in one of the weakly typed language as Javascript. Every pattern is explained very carefully with a lot of details and examples. Almost every line of code is commented and explained.<br />
I often use this book to remember how to implement certain pattern which I don't use so much.<br />
The book has my full recommendation as it is worth of reading.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">When I first saw a zero words presentation, a couple of years ago, it took me a while before i could recover from the positive shock it made on me. How comes that someone can stand up for 30 minutes and talk business with no bullet point slides? And be entertaining and connected with the audience instead of boring and pointless?<br />
<br />
Then it was time for Steve Jobs keynote speech on iPhone...yesss, that was a show! :)<br />
<br />
These emotions came back suddenly when a colleague suggested me to have a look at<br />
Presentation Zen by Garr Raynolds. I read the introduction by Guy Kawasaki - now one of my favourite authors - and I clicked.<br />
<br />
The book offers a new perspective into delivering a presentation, no more bullet-points or verbose slides but rather visual contents, so that you can reach out to your audience in a much more effective way. Of course the idea is detrimental to the cut+paste pattern, and calls for more preparation work and presentation skills. Fortunately, the book covers that too, and helps you to reconsider important aspects such as connecting to the audience, adapt to circumstances, stay focused, consciously use your voice, etc.<br />
<br />
You are warned: it might be difficult to make others believe you have done your homework<br />
even though you have no bullet-point slides to show :) so perhaps a good suggestion (not in<br />
the book) is to wisely choose how to start practising your visual presentation skills. In any case, a book well worth reading and a very useful reference for your next speeches<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Honestly speaking I don't consider myself an expert concurrent programming developer. With Programming Concurrency on the JVM, Venkat was able to clearly explain me the difficulties of the traditional (shared mutability) Java concurrency programming model and provide me alternatives programming models and design techniques (basically by promoting isolated mutability and pure immutability).<br />
<br />
The book is fairly practical and easy to read. Code samples accurately compare the ""performance"" of the different solutions. I appreciated the choice of the author to keep the same samples all along the book and to solve them with the different approaches. It made direct comparisons between those approaches easy.<br />
<br />
A very pleasant surprise has been to discover how the book is up-to-date: Java 7 Fork-Join API is explained on chapter 4.<br />
<br />
When I started reading the book I didn't pay attention to the tittle and I was expecting a Java book. However all the samples are also presented in Scala offering the reader a possibility to compare Java vs. Scala code. Beside Java and Scala, chapters 7 and 9 show how to deal with concurrency on Groovy and JRuby.<br />
<br />
Actor based samples are mainly done using Akka (GPars is introduced for the groovy language). Two Software Transactional Memory are explained: Clojure STM and Akka/Multiverse STM.<br />
<br />
The book is a highly recommended compendium of Java Concurrency in Practice.<br />
<br />
Well done Venkat!</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">I have many years of Java development behind me so when people recommended this book I thought: Uff, one more book about Java. How is it possible to write an interesting book after all the already existing Java books? Then I started reading random sections and I had to change my mind. The book is written for experienced Java developers. It won’t explain the basics of programming in Java (nothing for newbies) but it concerns itself with the real issues of developers.<br />
<br />
The book is divided in 78 items and, for every topic, it comes with clear explanations and recommended solutions. The explanations are mostly concise and to the point (only a few times did I have to skip some pages of, in my opinion, theoretical discussions).<br />
This book is actually a second edition (revised for Java 6) and was started for Java 5. So particular attention is given to the new features of Java 5 such as Generics, Autoboxing, Enums and Annotations.  <br />
<br />
If you are wondering if you should read the book just check if you know the answer to the following simple questions.<br />
• What are the advantages of a static factory over a constructor?<br />
• What’s wrong with the statement String s= new String(“hello”); ?<br />
• What are the dangers of Autoboxing?<br />
• What are the dangers of overriding equals?<br />
• How do I eliminate unchecked warnings?<br />
• When are Lists better than Arrays?<br />
• What’s the problem with float and double?<br />
• Why is implementing serializable a delicate issue?<br />
<br />
If you know all the answers then you still might want to read it for a clear and precise explanation.<br />
<br />
The fact that the book doesn’t have to be read from cover to cover following a strict order makes it a book that you can pick when you have 10 minutes to spare and just read one item at the time. That’s, at least, how I read it and it improved or reassured my knowledge of the Java Language.<br />
<br />
So I’m recommending the book and I say: Good job Joshua!</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">I was curious to know details and how to program on Google App Engine since 6 months. I installed it in my development environment and tried a DIY approach reading nice documents and articles from the web. I was able to get started and to extend some examples. But I was missing a complete overview of the system and I was not able to optimize my application architecture in order to get advantage of the powerful features implemented in GAE.<br />
After reading the book I changed my mind about how should I develop my applications to run on GAE.<br />
The book gives a overview on GAE architecture, on the developer environment (using Eclipse), on web request and Tasks handling. This introduction is sufficient to get the basic concepts to start developing. <br />
Very interesting is the deep explanation of the datastore structure and the best ways to use it (and workaround its limits).  5 chapters very well written and complete, with examples in both Python and Java code.<br />
The chapter on Django integration (a web framework) covers only the Python language, for Java you have to choose the framework you prefer and integrate it using resources on the web, not a big deal, but this is the only chapter I was missing in the book.<br />
Overall I consider the book a good and complete reference. A great point to start for new GAE developers .</p>

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">DB, NoSQL, Cassandra</p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Cassandra is one of the most famous NoSQL database. It was created by Facebook and it was open-sourced in July 2008. Cassandra was accepted into the Apache Incubator and from March 2010 is one of the top project.<br />
In the same period I started to develop a project based upon the Cassandra db.<br />
One of the major drawbacks was the total lack of a book dedicated to it while the official  <br />
documentation wasn’t so accurated.<br />
“Cassandra - The Definitive Guide” is written by Eben Hewitt. He is the Director of Application Architecture at a global hotelier where he focus on event-driven SOA, BPM, mobile, and big data solutions to support them. He wrote also “Java SOA Cookbook”.<br />
“Cassandra - The Definitive Guide” was released in the November 2010 and is what I’d like to have when I started to work on Cassandra.<br />
This book can be useful both for people that want to know more about the topic and for people with a good background on it.<br />
Some chapters as “Introducing Cassandra” or “Installing Cassandra” explain what Cassandra is and how successfully install it. This chapters are useful for the Cassandra newbie.<br />
Other chapters as “The Cassandra Data Model” are very important because they help to understand the difference respect to an E/R data model. Some chapters are about the internal structure of the project (as “The Cassandra Architecture”) while others are really useful for the production deploy and maintenance of the application and the db (“Monitoring”, “Maintenance” or “Performance Tuning”).<br />
“Cassandra - The Definitive Guide” is a good book and I feel to suggest it to everyone that want to know more about the argument but also to the developer and the system administrator that yet work on it.</p>

					<p class="keywords">REST</p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">When I started reading “REST in Practice” looking for an in depth book on “what” REST is, “when” it's a viable solution and “why” one should use it. I was less interested in “how” to implement a REST service.<br />
<br />
I'm really satisfied on what I found.<br />
<br />
The book use the development of an example service to guide the reader throw the different aspects of REST without spending too much time in the implementation details, but concentrating on the understanding of the concepts.<br />
<br />
The examples in the different chapters use different tools and languages, ensuring the reader don't get lost in the details of the tools but remain focused on the architecture, with the help of concrete examples. Instead if one is looking for a comprehensive guide to a specifict tool he'll have to look elsewere (like “RESTful Java – with JAX-RS” from Bill Burke, O'Really).<br />
As a downside I have to admit that it was hard to resist the temptation of skipping examples using uninteresting (to me) technologies (all the .NET stuff).<br />
<br />
In general I can say that the book is really clear and I found it's level appropriate to guide the reader through the comprehension of the different arguments.<br />
<br />
There is just one argument that I'd like the book have spent more time on: transactions. It's treated in a small section near the end of the book and I have to admit that I still don't have a clear understanding of it. I have also to say that it isn't a bad thing if a book leaves the reader with the desire of further studying on some aspects.<br />
<br />
I suggest this reading to all that are interested in the REST architecture or in the development of web services in general.</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">A practical and effective guide written by Michael W. Lucas, a FreeBSD committer, with a foreword of Robert Watson, FreeBSD foundation President.<br />
<br />
This book covers all the aspects of installation and configuration process: it guides you step by step until you’ve got the power!<br />
But not only that, it’s also useful after installation, with concise and very “not-only-geek-readable” tips on how to configure and manage services.<br />
I found the chapter called “The Network” very interesting. It explains with comprehensive words what actually a network is, how TCP/IP protocol works and how FreeBSD handles it.<br />
<br />
I found also author's writing style amazing! The book is funny and serious at the same time... do you want an example of this? Read chapter four “Read this before you break something else”: it covers an important (and boring) field such as “backup and recovery” but with a funny style!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, if you planned to learn all about FreeBSD don’t miss this book!</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">HTML5 is still pretty much a moving target, it's good to be familiar with it and the innovations that brings to the table, but implementation among various browsers is still spotty at the time of writing. The author are clearly aware of this, so they aren't trying to cover everything that HTML5 and related technologies bring to the table, the book is mostly focused on how you can use HTML5 here and now. So this isn't going to be a reference book that would last for many years, read it now because it's going to become more or less outdated as soon as browsers will improve in the near future.<br />
<br />
Bruce and Remy are really passionate about the subject, and they somewhat tend to assume a kind of ""evangelist"" tone, something I don't like very much (maybe that's just me). Still they know very well what they are talking about, and the info they deliver is worth reading and absorbing.<br />
<br />
Just a note on typography, New Riders usually does a very good job on printing visually appealing books. But this time I feel they made something wrong, many code samples don't stand out enough from the rest of the page, making them hard to spot and read them when you are quickly scanning the pages.</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Search is a critical part of every application. But, what is ‘search’ today? Behind this simple term there is a lot of work and study to do to offer users the best experience. Nowadays search doesn’t mean only keyword finding.<br />
Peter Morville and Jeffery Callender investigate many fields such as psychology, interaction design, information architecture and technology in order to show us what are the right patterns we should apply when developing and designing for search.<br />
The main suggestion authors give to the reader is to let the user explore while searching. Starting for a simple keyword term and then refining results while iterating. <br />
With the help of many screenshots and illustrations, the book shows a lot of patterns used in search: some are well known such as auto-complete, suggestions, advanced search and filtering; some of them could result ‘invisible’ but really helpful too. Each pattern is analyzed in different contexts (web, mobile...). <br />
Following these paths helps designers and developers offer the right tools to users to live the best experience of search while achieving their main goal: find useful and meaningful informations. <br />
Particularly interesting is the last part of the book where the authors explore how search will be in future, for example, when there will be a wide adoption of advanced mobile devices with features like augmented reality and virtuality.<br />

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">Internet marketing, online social networks</p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">If you think marketing is an unproven practice to lure prospects, then web marketing is all that in a new domain - the internet - where many marketing professionals still are unfamiliar with. And social marketing poses these challenges at scale! <br />
Therefore, marketing pros willing to achieve results on the web must dominate the field, or face overwhelming failure. Imagine someone's misstep in marketing to Facebook users...firefighters may not be enough :)<br />
The book by Dan Zarrella is an introduction to the various type of tools available to marketing pros promoting their products on the web, how to measure campaign results. It very much addresses the need of those not very familiar with the most common sites and communities.<br />
The book is introductory, so experienced and long-time twitterers or facebookers will not do much with this book. Otherwise, the book will bring you up to speed with the buzz around social networking and related marketing approaches.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">I start reading this book when I was looking for a quick command reference to use for teaching linux to people that never heard of it before; I found it simply FANTASTIC! It’s a clever reference of (almost) anything about linux!<br />
<br />
Beware: if you’re looking for a beginner guide, don’t buy this book! As suggested by the authors, it’s useful for those people who already knows linux.<br />
<br />
This book covers thousands of commands with a clean layout (like “man” but more powerful) and other important topics such as:<br />
<br />
- bash shell reference<br />
- package management systems (yum, apt)<br />
- gawk, vim, ex reference<br />
- git, svn reference<br />
- virtualization how-to<br />
<br />
In few words, “Linux in a Nutshell” is a complete reference that you should always have on your desk, even if you’re a linux “power user” or a system administrator.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Before start reading this book, I was almost convinced that black magic had more clear and predictable rules than search engine optimization. It happened to me lots of times to read a blog post suggesting a given strategy in order to improve the search ranking of a web site and then to find another post, from an equally authoritative author, giving exactly the opposite advice. Are URLs containing keywords important or not influential to the eyes of a search engine? To repeat the same keyword more and more times in the same page is positive or detrimental? You can find people saying everything and its exact contrary when speaking about these topics.<br />
<br />
This book analyzes these and many more controversial arguments by clarifying how search engines works on their respect and then suggesting the best actions to take in order to make your web site more appealing to them. Indeed, in my opinion, this is one of the most valuable characteristic of the book: it explains the algorithms implemented by people who write the search engines themselves. That makes the set of the suggestions it gives not another list of ingredients to be added to a mysterious magic formula, but, more practically, just a list of viable advices justified by well stated technical reasons.<br />
<br />
If I should make a compliant about the book it is that in some cases it sounds a bit redundant. The same concepts are repeated here and there with tons of sometimes trivial and avoidable examples. I admit too many examples is better than too few, and probably this choice has been made with the purpose to make the book accessible by people with very heterogeneous technical skills. However I believe that to cut some not strictly useful parts could make the book a bit more fluent and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
In the end I recommend this book to everybody interested in search engine optimization. The black art of SEO is a bit less obscure now.<br />

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">java, rest </p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">This book is a fresh rediscovery of http and the web<br />
<br />
The introductory chapter gives an overview of what REST is, and how JAX-RS specifications address this philosophy.<br />
<br />
Each chapter describes part of JAX-RS accurately and clearly and the snippets of code presented are properly explained.<br />
The last chapters present the integration with the most popular JEE frameworks: EJB and Spring and a really helpful explanation about the available tools to perform test of Restful applications<br />
<br />
For each chapter of theory, in the second part of the book, a workbook, there is a chapter with examples. Such organization allows you to get an overview of the API without having to constantly jump pages containing examples and yet is simple to move from theory to practice going to the matching section of the workbook.<br />
<br />
Following the directions of the workbook, you can easily download the source code which contains plenty of well documented examples.<br />
<br />
The only fact to be moved is the explicit statement that the code as presented should not be used in production (not for copyright issues): a novice can only imagine what its limits are but without having an alternative.<br />
 <br />
It is well written, focused on the subject and easily understood.<br />
<br />
This book is an excellent tutorial and a quick reference. <br />

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">scala, functional programmin, actors, multithread </p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">This book is a fast paced and 'pragmatic' introduction to Scala, a new programming language that mixes functional and OO concepts.<br />
It is for Java programmers who want to take the adventure to learn this interesting language.<br />
<br />
The book is structured as a single programming exercise to create a multi-threaded application.<br />
The first two chapters provide an overview of the purpose to be achieved also by presenting snippets of code unreadable for those who have yet to learn the language.<br />
At this point the reader have already learned an important lesson: Scala is not Java. It integrates quite seamlessly with java and the code runs on the JVM but definitely it is not Java.<br />
<br />
Who will stop here, have the impression that Scala is only a kind of typed version of something similar to javascript.<br />
Who continues finds that each of the other chapters deals with a part of the initial problem using specific Scala constructs, and any new syntax is explained very clearly.<br />
<br />
All the pieces fit with one another until the presentation of the argument that gives the title: multi core complexity, i.e. multi-threading.<br />
It turns out that the mechanism for the management of competition in Scala is borrowed from functional languages (especially Haskell), and is based on immutable objects eliminating the race conditions at the root.<br />
<br />
A chapter is devoted to how to test Scala programs with a quick introduction to the available frameworks.<br />
<br />
At the end of the book the application is build with the components developed along the way and at last the first two chapters make sense. Better late than never!<br />
<br />
The code that accompanies the book contains all the examples presented and can be used easily. A note: Some examples include programming errors, the same errors are present in the corresponding source code which obviously does not compile.<br />
<br />
This book in a good introduction to the basics of Scala and could convince the skeptical to give it a try.<br />

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">mobile, design, web</p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">First of all, let's clear the field from a possible misunderstanding: this book is not about general mobile design and development but it is about web mobile development. The author states a precise, despite arguable, opinion that brutally said is: do not code native applications but prefer as much as you can web applications. This statement is largely discussed across the book and everyone can make up his own opinion about this. Mine is that currently times are not mature to consider to write just web applications both because mobile browser are not powerful enough (on average) to assure a smooth experience on all devices and because of the lack of a good way to make money from your web app.<br />
The first three chapters of the book are a really good introduction to the history of mobile, to the mobile current status and to the reasons that should drive an approach to the mobile development. These chapters are a well written recap of the status of the art and present a lot of data useful to understand the global situation. Unfortunately the book is printed in black and white and several pie-charts and graphs are pretty much impossible to read.<br />
The central part of the book, chapters from four to ten, is devoted to design issues and, despite the lack of an in-depth examination of some subjects, offers a pretty good survey of the topic.<br />
The final part of the book is slightly more technical covering topics such as XHTML-MP, CSS, HTML5, device adaptation, etc. The problem here is that there is nothing really practical and all remains at an introductory level. To give you an example, a capital topic in device adaptation like Media Queries is covered in half a page with just a trivial example. Furthermore the author seems to be unaware of things like XwapProfile or UAProf (that is probably a obsolete and unreliable method but deserve at least a notation).<br />
My biggest complain is anyway about the author's obsession for the iPhone. The Apple's jewel is referenced continuously and always with great glorification: the word iPhone recurs 99 times in the book and out of the 115 pictures in the book as many as 37 depict an iPhone. An entire chapter is devoted to iPhone web applications development even though most of the concepts presented here are common to other modern devices.<br />
This is overall a decent introductory book, if you are completely new to the field, and it's packed with many good advices but do not expect much from the practical techniques promised by the title.<br />

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">iphone, iphone development, iphone sdk, objective-c </p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">What would you expect from a book entitled “iPhone SDK Development”? I don't know what your answer is but mine is: a complete series of tutorial on what you have to know about iPhone development without hassle or beating about the bush. If you consider this as a promise, well, this book honors the oath.<br />
<br />
The first impression you get flipping through the pages is that the book is really well organized. The authors start by presenting a simple no-brainer tutorial to create your first “hello iPhone” application and then step back in the following chapter to explain in detail what you have already done giving you also an Objective-C primer.<br />
The remaining chapters of the book actually dissect every aspect of the iPhone development: from controllers to database; from networking to media management; including accelerometer and map rendering. All topics are covered with a wealth of examples and explanations.<br />
<br />
Two very little complains.<br />
The prose is sometime too prolix; maybe here and there some pages could have been saved using a more concise style. Probably, anyway, this can be even seen as a value if you appreciate long, well-written and a little tedious descriptions.<br />
The second remark is about the OpenGL treatment that is very brief. I agree with the authors when they state that a complete discussion on OpenGL deserves a book on itself but nonetheless I would have appreciated something more.<br />
<br />
The book ends with three very useful chapters about debugging, performance tuning and marketing.<br />
In my opinion it can be read cover-to-cover like a course book but it will also be invaluable as a handy reference.<br />
All the examples can be downloaded from the companion web site (alongside errata corrige). There is also a forum where an active and vital community discusses development problems with the authors that seem really quick answering.<br />
<br />
Recommended.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Libro molto interessante, pieno di spunti e consigli preziosi per lo sviluppo di siti e di applicazioni web basati su javascript;<br />
gli argomenti trattati sono molto vari: dalla ottimizzazione della pagina in modo da ridurre i tempi di caricamento, alla velocizzazione delle operazioni sul DOM in modo che il browser non sia costretto<br />
a renderizzare troppo spesso porzioni di pagina; vengono descritti l'uso delle espressioni regolari, la scrittura di loop, la valutazione di condizioni multiple e in ogni caso è presentata<br />
una analisi attenta anche al minimo dettaglio: in alcuni casi si tratta di guadagnare solo qualche millisecondo - che può diventare importante se il codice in esame viene attraversato migliaia di volte! -, altre volte<br />
di evitare che il browser mostri l'antipatica finestra che informa l'utente che l'operazione in corso sta impiegando troppo tempo per essere eseguita; oppure che si superino i limiti imposti per la ricorsione.<br />
<br />
Sono sempre considerati i maggiori browser, a partire dall'ormai antico Internet Explorer 6 e sono presentati numerosi diagrammi a barre a corredo dei dati raccolti, di modo che ci si possa facilmente fare un'idea<br />
dell'impatto che può avere un determinato collo di bottiglia sulle diverse piattaforme.<br />
<br />
A volte sono presentate diverse soluzioni per lo stesso problema.<br />
Sarà lo sviluppatore a dover scegliere quella che più si adatta al proprio caso, anche in base ai browser e alle funzionalità supportate: setTimeout o WebWorkers?<br />
switch... case, if o un oggetto utilizzato come "mappa" per diversi valori?<br />
<br />
Alla fine è presentata una carrellata degli strumenti che aiutano quotidianamente lo sviluppatore nel proprio lavoro, con particolare attenzione a firebug e ai suoi plugins.<br />
<br />
Il testo è sempre molto scorrevole ed è piacevole da leggere, consigliabile a chiunque abbia già delle conoscenze di base del linguaggio e voglia (e possa) cimentarsi con la difficile arte di scrivere del codice<br />
"scattante" in questo linguaggio che sta diventando sempre più importante.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Reading a book on legal topics might seem a daunting perspective for someone with a technical background, and I shared this viewpoint before start reading Intellectual Property and Open Source. <br />
<br />
For instance, one thing I noticed as common practice in legal contracts is referring to later content. E.g. it is typical that wording in clause 8 makes reference to what is stated in clause 9, or 11. This clashes with a developer - i.e. analytical - mindset, where you can only build on what has already been defined and/or computed, not on something which is following next :)<br />
<br />
With this in mind, I approached the book openly and I was pleased to find that the author could seamlessly take me throught aspects of patent law, copyright, trademarks, etc. with a very accessible language, clear examples, and honest considerations. <br />
<br />
Most of the chapters, particularly in the second half of the book, take the developer's perspective on open source licensing. The author jumps in the oss developer's shoes to figure out what licensing is all about, what you need to consider when chosing a licence for your own code, and IP aspects you should consider when working either as an employee or a freelance.<br />
<br />
Examples are often taken from prominent case studies, and it is easy to remember them and the argument they referred to. While deep and clear, the author succeeds not to indulge too much in legalese, which is good when you are not a lawyer :P<br />
<br />
Most popular open source licences are included in appendix for reference, so that they don't get in the way when you are focusing on specific aspects of IP. For this reason, I believe that the book can serve both as an introduction to IP in oss and a reference book.<br />
<br />
A must have book for developers keen on their own IP rights and willing to contribute to open source communities.</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Managing and analyzing huge data sets has become a very common problem in various areas of modern information technology, from different types of Web applications (social, financial, trading, ...) to  applications for analyzing scientific data.<br />
<br />
Distributed systems over a cluster of machines are almost a mandatory choice in such cases, but designing and implementing an effective solution in those areas may be troublesome and become a nightmare.<br />
<br />
The Apache Hadoop Project is an infrastructure that helps the construction  of reliable, scalable, distributed systems. Mainly known for its MapReduce and distributed file system &#40;HDFS&#41; subprojects, it actually includes other services that complement or extend them. <br />
<br />
Tom Whites' "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" is an enjoyable book which fully explains these complex technologies. The book is organized in such a way that the reader is gently guided into the Hadoop ecosystem. It begins with a couple of very readable chapters as a general introduction to the problems Hadoop is meant to solve and the main solutions to them (MapReduce and HDFS), then examines closely all its aspects, often describing what really happens under the scenes, giving useful design suggestions and common pitfalls descriptions. When reading this book you won't be overwhelmed by tons of lines of code: examples are short and yet effective.<br />
<br />
This kind of structure makes it hard to classify the book as a mere tutorial or as a real reference guide, it can be rather considered a mix of the two. If this turns out to be a positive choice in many ways, it has some drawbacks:  the reader is sometimes forced to go back and forth through the chapters and has to read it almost entirely to get a full understanding. But this is perhaps the price to pay for having a fluent and pleasant reading.<br />
<br />
Let's go quickly through the chapters:<br />
<br />
The first chapter is a brief history of Hadoop project illustrating its main characteristics and comparing them to those of others similar technologies. Chapter two is a pleasant introduction to MapReduce. The third chapter breaks the continuity of the previous one examining the Hadoop Distributed File System &#40;HDFS subproject&#41; in detail. Chapter four makes a step down in the abstraction layer talking about the Hadoop  I/O fundamentals: data integrity, compression, serialization and data structures, explaining the design choice. <br />
<br />
Chapters five to eight are an excellent source for learning Hadoop MapReduce in depth. They cover all the aspects of it: starting from practical ones, such as how to configure, run, test and debug map reduce programs, to those more advanced and formal, like programming models, data formats, sorting and joining tools.<br />
<br />
The two following chapters list few very interesting and useful suggestions for  managing and setting up a Hadoop cluster, a precious resource for administrators.<br />
<br />
Chapters eleven to thirteen are for Pig, HBase and Zookeper subprojects under the Hadoop umbrella. Despite of suffering from brevity, they are still interesting.<br />
<br />
Chapter fourteen is made for the reader not to feel alone: important case studies using Hadoop (e.g. Yahoo, and others contributions from Apache Hadoop community). <br />
<br />
My final opinion is that "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" is a very useful resource for those who want to learn how to ride the "pachydermic" Hadoop (like a "Mahout", perhaps?).<br />

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">scala, functional programming</p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">One of the book's authors worked at Twitter, and knowing that Scala is the platform used to develop Twitter immediately makes this book very promising.<br />
<br />
The Scala programming language requires a relatively long time to be understood, even for programmers coming from other mainstream languages such as Java.<br />
<br />
Scala is introduced in the first chapter as a language to address the major needs of modern development. To explain the power of Scala the authors compare it with other popular programming languages such as Java, C#, Ruby, Python, PHP. How to install the Scala environment and complete HelloWorld is also presented.<br />
<br />
Subsequent chapters delve into concepts of the Scala programming language like syntax, traits, oo and  functional programming, concurrency with actors, DSLs,  Type system.<br />
<br />
A very interesting chapter is devoted to application design in Scala. <br />
<br />
The last chapter covers the tools, the libraries and the IDE support for Scala.<br />
<br />
The book contains many (working) examples that are very useful when you aim to learn the Scala structure. Authors use a plain and simple language and helps to easily understand the complexities of the subject matter. <br />
<br />
One of the major hallmarks of the book is that the authors try to use the Scala syntax that they consider the best from the first examples. This helps to learn from the begin what the authors consider best practice when programming in Scala. On the other hand, for newbies it can turn out to be difficult to understand why it's better to use some structure or syntax instead of others.<br />
<br />
Overall "Programming Scala" is neat and most remarkably one of the best ways to enter the wonderful world of Scala.</p>

					<h5>Keywords</h5>
					<p class="keywords">Real Time, java</p><br/>
					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">This book starts very intriguing: An elavator is a real time system. A web server is not.<br />
Real Time in not 'run as fast as you can' like the Gingerbread says. It is all about reliable timing.<br />
<br />
This book explain in thorough (very thorough) detail what's wrong with standard java and what happens when RTSJ comes to the rescue.<br />
You will learn how the garbage collector, a bad guy of standard java, is tamed, the JIT compiler, another nasty mug, is rendered harmless and how you can instruct threads to perform exactly what you want and not let them dawdle.<br />
<br />
You will find:<br />
long deep theoretical explanations of how the garbage collertors are (or could be) implemented and<br />
long deep theoretical and practical explanations of how you can avoid the JIT compiler and<br />
long deep theoretical and practical explanations of how you can avoid the dynamic classloading and<br />
long deep explanations of how to set up a real time environment: the JVM itself need a real time operating system &#40;windows is obviously excluded&#41;<br />
<br />
Until you will see what means to write a program with RTSJ: in same ways is like coming back to C and sit right on the memory...<br />
<br />
The examples in the book quite gently introduce you to the core concepts and the final application wraps up all the tecniques useful in RTSJ described in the book.<br />
<br />
It's an interesting book if you want to learn the internals of java or if you need to evaluate real time java for your next project.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Approaching a book about a brand new technology can be dangerously misleading because you can end up to write about the latter instead to focus on the former. On the other side it’s really hard to separate the two things but I swear that I’ll do my best.<br />
<br />
Let’s start talking about the book intended audience.  The authors target the book to Java developers and to graphic designers as well. Probably people without a specific programming background will have some serious difficulties to follow many of the topics covered in the book. Speaking as a Java programmer I’d have appreciated more explanations where needed on the differences between Java and JavaFX script.<br />
<br />
(Personal annotation. I looked astonished for five minutes at this <br />
<br />
      var num = if(sizeof args > 0) {<br />
           java.lang.Integer.valueOf(args[0]);<br />
      } else {<br />
           10;<br />
      }<br />
<br />
before be acquainted with it. The JavaFX Script programming language is indeed an expression language, which means that everything, including loops, conditionals and even blocks, are expressions and can return a value.)<br />
<br />
The first two chapters of the book are devoted to set up the environments for both the programmers and the graphic designers.  In a few pages it really makes clear how to get started using NetBeans or Eclipse (for programmers) and Photoshop or Illustrator (for graphic designers). Just to reassure you: yes, "Hello, world!" is the very first example of the book.<br />
<br />
In chapters three and four authors introduce the core of the JavaFX scripting language. Topics like sequences, expressions, binding and triggers are clearly covered with many short examples.<br />
<br />
After this boring but necessary stuff the fireworks begin. From the chapter five to eight the power of JavaFX is unleashed: the creation of cool and appealing user interfaces.<br />
The theater metaphor within the JavaFX user interface framework is really well covered. The reader will learn about the Stage, the Scene and the Nodes and how they combine as basic elements to make complex user interfaces. Special effects and animations are topics exceptionally well enlightened with clear descriptions, many examples, pictures and graphs.<br />
In comparison, the multimedia topic is covered extremely concisely.  This is due to the fact that putting images and video in a JavaFX project is really simple. <br />
<br />
The publication of JavaFX project is an important topic covered in good detail in the chapter nine. The use of applet and Java Web Start as a way of publication is explained with many hints and with a cool paragraph about the integration between JavaFX and JavaScript. Unfortunately no attention is paid to other publication methods like mobile or television profile.<br />
<br />
An advanced topic, namely the creation of RESTful applications, is covered in chapter ten which presents an example widget that shows current weather conditions using data received form external web services. <br />
<br />
Java programmers will then be grateful for the chapter eleven, which covers in deep detail the integration between JavaFX and Java, with many tables about function parameter and return mapping and about type conversion mapping.<br />
<br />
A special mention should be deserved for the contents of the chapter twelve, JavaFX Code Recipes. In this chapter the authors present many code samples that will help the reader in several real world situation. For a new technology like JavaFX the value of being taught by the creators comes out in this advices that surely help to understand the language and to avoid the traps.<br />
<br />
In the last chapter of the book a complete Sudoku application is presented. This is an invaluable reference because all the range of topics are dissected, starting from the concept and the design, to the logic, to the interface. Many excerpts of code are analyzed with several useful considerations.<br />
<br />
The book has been written before the specification JavaFX 1.2 was finalized. So in many parts of the book the authors complain the absence of definitive example and send the reader to the web site in which they’ll publish as soon as finished new chapters on 1.2 and revised examples.  As this review has been written, those chapters have not yet been published on the web site. The examples instead have been updated for 1.2 specifications and can be downloaded for free.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this is a really good book to learn JavaFX. All topics are presented clearly and the overall readability of the book is excellent. It should be used for linear reading only; it hardly will work as a reference. JavaFX experts will do better looking somewhere else. New comers of the technology (with a good background of Java) will probably not find any better.</p>

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Java Fundamentals I and II by Dietel & Associates, Inc<br />
 <br />
Java Fundamentals I and II is a multimedia Java programming language course. It's composed by 14 hours of video tutorials in 2 Dvd plus one book with code used in the video tutorials.<br />
In the first Dvd, 7 hours of video are dedicated to the basic Java concepts: statements, classes and objects.<br />
In the second dvd are approached the object oriented concept like inheritance and polymorphism.<br />
In both Dvd there are tutorials about Netbeans and Eclipse very useful to the beginners.<br />
 <br />
The course don't need to be installed, there's a software that play video tutorials, you put inside and go. It run on Windows 2000, XP , Vista and on Mac but not on Linux (!!) you should use wine to run it on Linux but i didn't tested it. It would be fine if it could run on Linux too.<br />
The Dvd needs at least 1280x960 video resolution so should not work fine on all personal computers. The course doesn't run on a dvd player, that improvement would be nice too , because you can work on the code you're learning while watching it on Tv.<br />
 <br />
The interface is simple and very easy to use.<br />
Video tutorials are in English, Steve Dietel talk in all of them.  It is not available another language or subtitles, but the English is clear for a non English speaker too. A good improvement could be to add subtitles, so it would be easier for non English speaker to follow the course.<br />
Another good improvement would be add a bookmark, so if you have to stop for any reason the tutorial you can easily start from that point.<br />
 <br />
The strong point of the course is the “live code” approach , that means Java concepts in a working context. I found very easy to learn while working . For a lot of people this is the best approach and it's not boring indeed. To go further there's a lot of stuff on the editor website www.deitel.com.<br />
It's not required Object Oriented programming skill to follow the course, it's easy  for people that have few experience in programming. Everything you need is in the course.<br />
A very nice feature is that after the course you learn how to help yourself with Java API, essential skill for a Java programmer.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I found Java Fundamentals very nice and complete, is highly suggested for people that never have played with Java but have generic programming skill, after the course the student will be able to write simple programs and to go further with practice. It could be a good inspiration  for teacher too I suggest for the beginners to start the course  following the tutorials on Netbeans or Eclipse, so you can easily repeat and improve the code of the course. Another good improvement would be to put some exercise about topic covered.<br />
 <br />
Topics covered: Introduction to Java applications, introduction to Classes and Objects, Control Statements, Methods, Arrays, Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Introduction to Graphical User Interfaces and Event Handling, Exception Handling, The Collection Framework, Introduction to NetBeans, Introduction to Eclipse.<br />

					<h5>Review:</h5>
					<p class="review">Programmers spend probably more than 80% of their time reading someone else code instead of writing their own. This is why is important that who writes the code pays particular attention not only to what it does but also to how it does that. For example, for a compiler doesn't make any difference if a variable is called p or pageCounter, but of course it makes a big difference for the programmer who have to figure out what kind of information that variable contains. That explains why it is easier to write code for compilers than for people.<br />
<br />
Of course a well chosen name is definitively not enough to make your code readable. This book provides some really good principles that all developers can benefit from using in order to make your code more readable and consequently cheaper to be maintained and easier to be refactored. Among the suggestions made by the book to achieve these results you can find:<br />
<br />
    * keep each method as short as possible: 15 lines of code is a reasonable limit that should not be overcome;<br />
    * give each method a single responsibility: if you are trying to give a meaningful name to the method and it comes out that the name should contain an "and" there is a big likelihood that you are breaking this rule;<br />
    * never declare a method with more than 3 parameters: if you need more it is always a good idea to group them as properties of an object;<br />
    * don't use nested cycles or conditions: you can improve both readability and reusability by putting them in little separated methods;<br />
    * write comments only when strictly necessary and keep them updated with the code: there is nothing more useless than a comment that explains what you can easily read from the code or more confounding than a comment that says something different from what the code actually does;<br />
    * fix a set of shared coding standards: a programmer can understand a piece of code faster if he doesn’t meet unexpected surprises while reading it.<br />
<br />
Reading this book you will learn how to implement in your code these and other advices through lots of wonderfully clear and easily reusable examples. The book put an important accent also on how to make your code more robust by building a set of meaningful unit tests and how to leverage that test suite in order to safely improve your code through successive refinements.<br />
<br />
In the end this book will teach you how to make your code easily readable by another programmer, making his job more simple. And this is a valuable thing especially considering that there is a high possibility that the next programmer who will read that code could be yourself.</p>
